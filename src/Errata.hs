This module is for creating pretty error messages. We assume very little about the format you want to use, so much of
this module is to allow you to customize your error messages.

To get started, see the documentation for 'prettyErrors'. When using this module, we recommend you turn on the
@OverloadedStrings@ extension and import "Data.Text" at the very least due to the use of 'Data.Text.Text' (strict).

The overall workflow to use the printer is to convert your error type to 'Errata', which entails filling in messages
and 'Block's. You can create 'Errata' and 'Block' from their constructors, or use the convenience functions for
common usecases, like 'errataSimple' and 'blockSimple'.

For premade styles for blocks and pointers, take a look at "Errata.Styles".

For easier reading, we define:

> type Line = Int
> type Column = Int
> type Header = Text
> type Body = Text
> type Label = Text

{- | Pretty prints errors. The original source is required. Returns 'Data.Text.Lazy.Text' (lazy). If the list is empty,
an empty string is returned.

Suppose we had an error of this type:

> data ParseError = ParseError
>     { peFile       :: FilePath
>     , peLine       :: Int
>     , peCol        :: Int
>     , peUnexpected :: T.Text
>     , peExpected   :: [T.Text]
>     }

Then we can create a simple pretty printer like so:

@
import qualified Data.Text as T
import qualified Data.Text.Lazy.IO as TL
import           "Errata"

toErrata :: ParseError -> 'Errata'
toErrata (ParseError fp l c unexpected expected) =
    'errataSimple'
        (Just \"an error occured!\")
        ('blockSimple' 'Errata.Styles.basicStyle' 'Errata.Styles.basicPointer' fp
            (Just \"error: invalid syntax\")
            (l, c, c + T.length unexpected, Just \"this one\")
            (Just $ \"unexpected \" \<> unexpected \<> \"\\nexpected \" \<> T.intercalate \", \" expected))
        Nothing

printErrors :: T.Text -> [ParseError] -> IO ()
printErrors source es = TL.putStrLn $ 'prettyErrors' source (map toErrata es)
@

Note that in the above example, we have @OverloadedStrings@ enabled to reduce uses of 'Data.Text.pack'.

An example error message from this might be:

> an error occured!
> --> ./comma.json:2:18
> error: invalid syntax
>   |
> 2 |     "bad": [1, 2,]
>   |                  ^ this one
> unexpected ]
> expected null, true, false, ", -, digit, [, {
-}
prettyErrors :: Source source => source -> [Errata] -> TL.Text
prettyErrors source errs = TB.toLazyText $ renderErrors source errs
