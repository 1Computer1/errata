        {- Optimization: we use a Patricia tree (IntMap) indexed by start line
        into respective tail slices of the list of source lines @slines@.

        If we were to use the list @slines@ as-is:
            O(n) seeking per source block, O(n) traversal
        Since, we would be linearly traversing to the start of each source block every
        time with no caching for future source blocks at (or close to) the same starting
        line as previous source blocks.

        If we were to use an IntMap of source lines by itself:
            Seeking becomes free, at the expense of O(n log n) traversal per source block
        Since, we are performing an O(log n) average case Patricia lookup per line.

        Whereas if we use a hybrid IntMap + association list approach:
            O(n + log n) worst case, O(log n) average case, seeking per source block, O(n) traversal
        Worse case is unevaluated slices, as this would force @slices@ evaluation, which is
        an O(n) list traversal, on top of an O(log n) Patricia lookup. Partially-evaluated leafs will
        have slightly better asymptotics, and fully-evaluated leafs will be O(log n) average case,
        which is just the cost of a Patricia lookup.

        For sufficiently large block counts with scattered pointers per block, which we assume
        holds for real-world use cases, the traversal savings on repeat lookups will quickly favor
        hybrid association list + IntMap asymptotics.
